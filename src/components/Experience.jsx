            <ul>
              <li>Built and optimized end-to-end machine learning pipelines for fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), significantly improving detection precision across real-time data streams.</li>
              <li>Applied advanced supervised (Random Forest, XGBoost) and unsupervised (KMeans, Isolation Forest) models to identify anomalous sensor behavior with high accuracy.</li>
              <li>Performed statistical feature engineering on raw sensor data (temperature, humidity, voltage) to extract meaningful insights and improve model generalization.</li>
              <li>Developed a visual dashboard using Python and Matplotlib/Seaborn for dynamic performance monitoring, classification breakdowns, and sensor-specific fault mapping.</li>
              <li>Collaborated with faculty and peer researchers, contributed to drafting a conference paper focusing on ensemble ML techniques for edge-based fault classification.</li>
